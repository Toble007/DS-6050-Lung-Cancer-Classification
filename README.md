# DS-6050-Lung-Cancer-Classification
UVA's DS 6050 Group project on Lung Cancer Classification

This project was a group project on Deep Learning. 

The group found data through LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI. We preprocessed this data. Then, we created our own models and modified 3 large premade models created by researchers (transfer learning). These models were used to predict which lung ct scans are cancerous. We determined that InceptionResNetV2 was the best model to explore in the future.
